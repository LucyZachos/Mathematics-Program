# Mathematics Program üßÆ

A simple mathematics program created using C++ for academic purposes. This program allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Features üöÄ
- **User Input**: Accepts user input for the mathematical operator (+, -, *, /) and two numbers to perform the calculation.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors such as division by zero and incorrect operator input.
- **Looping**: Allows users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

### Usage ‚ÑπÔ∏è
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the mathematical operator (+, -, *, /).
3. Enter the first number.
4. Enter the second number.
5. View the result of the calculation.
6. Choose whether to perform another calculation.
